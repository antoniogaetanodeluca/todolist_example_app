# todolist_example_app

This is an example test app made in JavaScript that I'm writing in order to show how I code and in order to take records of what I'm doing for testing, experimenting and so on.

This app will be written using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery Framework, Bootstrap, SASS and the BEM methodology in ATOM editor with the help of GIT for file version control. 

Everything will be handled by a local LAMP stack on my Macbook Pro.

I will add React.js Framework after the first version will be completed.

Have fun, keep coding!

Cheers,

Antonio
