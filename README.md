# todolist_example_app

This is an example test app made in JavaScript that I'm writing in order to show how I code and in order to take records of what I'm doing for testing, experimenting and so on.

This app will be written using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery Library, Bootstrap, SASS and the BEM methodology.

Have fun, keep coding!

Cheers,

Antonio
